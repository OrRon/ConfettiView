# ConfettiView

Confetti View lets you create a magnificent confetti view in your app. This was inspired by [House Party](https://itunes.apple.com/il/app/houseparty-group-video-chat/id1065781769?mt=8) app's login screen. Written in Swift 3 :)

It reacts to the phone accelerometer therefore it's better to run the example project on the device.

## Usage
